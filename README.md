This repository contains scripts for analyses of a static and variable pH single generation selection experiment in S. purpuratus. 

## Data availability

## Scripts

Below are scripts to run the full analysis for the manuscript. A short description accompanies each.

### data processing, variant calling and filtering

### Analysis

- `gene_annotation_enrichment.md`
  - links SNPs to genes, gene annotations, and performs functional enrichment/ generates the GO figure.
